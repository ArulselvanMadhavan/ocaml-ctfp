# It's all about Morphisms
- Review of building blocks of hom-sets
- Adjunctions are defined in terms of isomorphisms of hom-sets
## Functors
- mappings of morphisms
- objects tell us which pairs of morphisms are composable.
## Commuting diagrams
- Used for expressing properties of morphisms
- Forms the basis of all universal constructions
## Natural Transformations
- NT - mapping from morphisms to commuting squares
- Naturality square - Two opposing sides are the mappings of a morphism f under F and G
- The other sides are the components of the NT
- Functor modifies the content of a container without changing its shape
- NT repackages the content in a different container without touching the contents.
- A limit is defined in terms of cones.
- Universal cone is the NT between the contravariant hom-functor
## Natural Isomorphisms
- National Isomorphims - A NT whose every component is reversible
## Hom-Sets
- Fix the source and target objects, the morphisms between the two form a boring set
- Difference between members of a hom-set lies in the way they compose with other morphisms
- Ff =/ Fg
## Hom-set Isomorphism
- Iso between hom-sets
- Plain isomorphism between them is not interesting.
- Meaningful iso should take into account the composition
- composition involves more than one hom-set
- Iso that span whole collection of hom-sets, and we need to impose some compatibility conditions that interoperate with composition
