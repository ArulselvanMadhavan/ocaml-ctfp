* OCaml version of Category Theory For Programmers

Resources I found useful as I started translating the book in OCaml:
1. https://github.com/freebroccolo/ocaml-cats
2. https://github.com/ocamllabs/higher

Thanks to @mseri for offering to do code review.

If you find any mistakes or want to improve code snippets, please submit a PR.

*** Currently working on auto inserting the snippets from this repo to the book.

** Completed work:
- Chapters 1 through 11 are available in the pdf format here: https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf/pull/201

** TODO:
- I am currently using a modified version of `mdx` to move snippets from this repo to the book repo - https://github.com/ArulselvanMadhavan/milewski-ctfp-pdf/tree/ocaml . Need to automate this and make it part of makefile
