* OCaml version of Category Theory For Programmers

Resources I found useful as I started translating the book in OCaml:
1. https://github.com/freebroccolo/ocaml-cats
2. https://github.com/ocamllabs/higher

Thanks to @mseri for offering to do code review.

If you find any mistakes or want to improve code snippets, please submit a PR.

*** Currently working on auto inserting the snippets from this repo to the book.
